Our player, the CodeCooler, (class: student), is travelling through the dangerous and wild world of programming. 'CodeCooler' needs to collect sufficient various items (Codewars kata and SI projects) in order to be prepared to defeat the final boss: the PA!

Items to collect:
- Codewars kata = 10 KP (knowledge points)
- programming languages (PL) = 25 KP (knowledge points)

The Bog Boss PA "battle": 
CodeCooler must have >= 100 KP to face 
Big Boss PA does damage to the player's KP by reducing the number by a randomly generated amount (between 30 - 70% damage)
